# CLAUDE.md

This is the Field Theory CLI: a local-first command-line companion for X bookmark sync, Field Theory Library workflows, portable commands, app install, and agent-facing context.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run dev          # Run via tsx directly
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run start        # Run compiled dist/cli.js
```

## Architecture

Single CLI application built with Commander.js. Bookmark data is stored in `~/.fieldtheory/bookmarks/`; Library markdown is stored in `~/.fieldtheory/library/`; portable commands live under `~/.fieldtheory/commands/`; and Possible run artifacts live under `~/.fieldtheory/ideas/`.

### Data flow

```
Chrome cookies → GraphQL API → JSONL cache → SQLite FTS5 index
                                    ↓
                           Regex classification
                                    ↓
                         Search / List / Viz
```

Field Theory app companion flow:

```text
~/.fieldtheory/library + ~/.fieldtheory/commands
                    ↓
              ft library / ft commands
                    ↓
    packaged Field Theory app or configured dev checkout
```

### Dependencies

All pure JavaScript/WASM — no native bindings:
- `commander` — CLI framework
- `sql.js` + `sql.js-fts5` — SQLite in WebAssembly
- `dotenv` — .env file loading

## Session habits

- Before editing, read the whole file (or the whole function you're changing) and plan the change. If you've edited the same spot three times for one request, stop and re-read the request: repeated patches usually mean it was misread.
- When I correct you, re-read my message and say in one line what changes, then do it. Ask first only if the correction is ambiguous.
- When the same approach fails twice (a command, a fix that doesn't hold), change approach instead of retrying it. If a second approach also fails, stop and tell me what you tried, what failed and what you'd try next.
- Before you report back, re-read my original message and check off every part of it; finish what's missing or say which parts are left and why. In a long session, also re-read it before starting each new part.
